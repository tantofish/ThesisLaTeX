\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{c:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a robust head pose estimation system that can give real-time responses to users without
having to resort to the massive parallel computational power of GPU. Therefore, our approach is not limited to powerful devices, and has large potential to be applied in a wide variety of applications. Besides, since the approach only relies on the depth map which is not affected by illumination variations, our system can works in s wide variety of environments, e.g. indoor, outdoor, well-lit, dark night. Moreover, the proposed approach neither requires the user to do any training procedure nor requires the user to wear any sensors or markers. In brief, the deployment of our system is easy and convenient enough to make it work successfully at any time, anywhere, with any user. 
For summary, this thesis has several contributions: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Two novel ideas has been proposed, one for real-time estimation with less computation resources, one for more robust but non real-time estimation. Both are not affected by varying lighting conditions.
 \item The precision and the computing time of our approach (optimiztion method) outperforms that of the
state-of-the-art approach\cite{Fanelli:11:RTHPEWRRF, fanelli_DAGM11} which adopts the same input device.
\end{itemize}
