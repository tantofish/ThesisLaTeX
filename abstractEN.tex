This thesis presents a system which estimates human head poses only using depth information in real-time. 
We first track the user's nose, and sample an amount of 3D points around the nose. 
Assuming that a head can be approximated by a bounding box, 
we use the point cloud to fit planes of the head by least square error method, 
the normal vector of the plane yields yaw and pitch angle of userâ€™s head orientation. 
On the other hand, ellipse fitting using head contour can provide the rolling angles. 
We adopt a real-time depth estimation method by using cameras such as Microsoft Kinect sensor. 
The simplicity of this acquisition device comes at the cost of high noises in the acquired data. 
Our system is not affected by the illumination conditions in environments since only depth information is required in our system. 
We demonstrate that 3D head pose estimation can be achieved in real-time with noisy depth data and without user calibration.
